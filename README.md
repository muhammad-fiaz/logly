## Getting Started

## Installation

To install the stable version of `logly`, use:
```bash
pip install logly
```

If you want to install the latest development version directly from GitHub, you can run:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly.git
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can use `logly` in your Python project for logging. Here is a basic example of how to set it up and use it:

```python
from logly import Logly, LoglyConfig
```

### Create a Logly Instance

You can create a Logly instance with default settings or customize the configuration:

#### Default Settings

```python
logly = Logly()
```

#### Custom Configuration

```python
config = LoglyConfig(display=True, log_to_file_enabled=True, default_file_path="logs/app.log")
logly = Logly(config=config)
```

### Start Logging

Enable logging to store logs in a text file and optionally display them in the console:

```python
# Start logging and display logs in the console
logly.start_logging()

# Start logging but do not display logs in the console
logly.start_logging(display=False)
```

### Stop Logging

Disable logging to a file and optionally stop displaying logs in the console:

```python
# Stop logging to file but continue displaying logs in the console
logly.stop_logging()

# Stop logging to file and stop displaying logs in the console
logly.stop_logging(display=False)
```

### Log Messages

Log messages with different levels and colors:

```python
logly.info("Application started successfully.")
logly.info("User logged in", color=Logly.COLOR.GREEN)  # with custom color

logly.info("Database connection established", "Connection details: host=db.local, port=5432", color=Logly.COLOR.CYAN)
logly.warn("API rate limit exceeded", "API request count exceeded 1000", color=Logly.COLOR.YELLOW)
logly.error("Database connection failed", "Unable to reach database at db.local", color=Logly.COLOR.RED)
logly.debug("User request details", "User requested resource /api/data", color=Logly.COLOR.BLUE)
logly.critical("Critical system failure", "Disk space usage exceeded 95%", color=Logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.fatal("Application crashed", "Unhandled exception in user module", color=Logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.trace("Debug trace", "Trace info: function call stack", color=Logly.COLOR.BLUE)
logly.log("System status", "All systems operational", color=Logly.COLOR.WHITE)
```

### Custom Log Format

You can customize the format of the log messages:

```python
config = LoglyConfig(custom_format="{timestamp} - {level} - {message}")
logly = Logly(config=config)
logly.start_logging()

logly.info("Custom format log message.")
```

### Disable File Logging

Disable logging to a file:

```python
logly.disable_file_logging()
```

### Enable File Logging

Enable logging to a file:

```python
logly.enable_file_logging()
```

### Set Default File Path

Set the default file path for log files:

```python
logly.set_default_file_path("logs/new_log.txt")
```

### Set Default Maximum File Size

Set the default maximum file size for log files:

```python
logly.set_default_max_file_size(50)  # 50 MB
```

## Example

```python
from logly import Logly, LoglyConfig

# Create a Logly instance with custom configuration
config = LoglyConfig(display=True, log_to_file_enabled=True, default_file_path="logs/app.log")
logly = Logly(config=config)

# Start logging to store the logs in a text file and display in console
logly.start_logging()

logly.info("Application started successfully.")
logly.info("User logged in", color=Logly.COLOR.GREEN)  # with custom color

# Log messages with different levels and colors
logly.info("Database connection established", "Connection details: host=db.local, port=5432", color=Logly.COLOR.CYAN)
logly.warn("API rate limit exceeded", "API request count exceeded 1000", color=Logly.COLOR.YELLOW)
logly.error("Database connection failed", "Unable to reach database at db.local", color=Logly.COLOR.RED)
logly.debug("User request details", "User requested resource /api/data", color=Logly.COLOR.BLUE)
logly.critical("Critical system failure", "Disk space usage exceeded 95%", color=Logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.fatal("Application crashed", "Unhandled exception in user module", color=Logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.trace("Debug trace", "Trace info: function call stack", color=Logly.COLOR.BLUE)
logly.log("System status", "All systems operational", color=Logly.COLOR.WHITE)

# Stop logging to file (messages will be displayed but not logged to file after this point)
logly.stop_logging()

# Log more messages after stopping logging to file (messages will be displayed but not logged in file)
logly.info("User session ended", "User logged out", color=Logly.COLOR.CYAN)
logly.warn("Low disk space", "Disk space is below 10%", color=Logly.COLOR.YELLOW)
logly.error("File not found", "Unable to find /config/settings.json", color=Logly.COLOR.RED)
```


if you faced an error like [`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'log.txt'`](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly/issues/4) you can use the following code snippet to set the default path

```python3
import os
from logly import Logly

logly = Logly() # initialize the logly
logly.start_logging() # make sure to include this or else the log will only display without storing it

logly.set_default_max_file_size(50) # optional
logger = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "log.txt") # This will ensure the path location to create the log.txt on current directory
logly.set_default_file_path(logger)
```

## Color Options:

### Default Color Options:

| Level    | Color Code      |
| -------- | --------------- |
| INFO     | CYAN            |
| WARNING  | YELLOW          |
| ERROR    | RED             |
| DEBUG    | BLUE            |
| CRITICAL | BRIGHT RED      |
| TRACE    | BLUE            |
| DEFAULT  | WHITE           |

### Custom Color Options:

You can use any of the following color codes for custom coloring:

| NAME     | Color Code      |
|----------| --------------- |
| CYAN      | CYAN            |
| YELLOW   | YELLOW          |
|  RED       | RED             |
|  BLUE      | BLUE            |
| BRIGHT RED | CRITICAL     |
|WHITE   | WHITE           |
| GREEN       | Fore.GREEN    |


For example, you can use `color=logly.COLOR.RED` for the red color.

## Tips & Tricks
If you want to use logly in your project files without creating a new object in each Python file or class, you can create a file named logly.py. In this file, initialize logly and configure the defaults. Now, you can easily import and use it throughout your project:

`logly.py`
```python3
# logly.py in your root or custom path
# Import Logly

from logly import Logly
import os
logly = Logly()
logly.start_logging()

# Set the default file path and maximum file size
logly.set_default_max_file_size(50)
logger = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "log.txt") # This will ensure the path location to create the log.txt 
logly.set_default_file_path(logger)

# Start logging again
logly.start_logging()
```
you can now use the logly by


`main.py`
```python3
from logly import logly # make sure to import it some IDE may automatically import it on top

logly.info("msg","hello this is logly", color=logly.COLOR.RED) # with custom color of red

```
### output 
```
[XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX: XX] INFO: msg: hello this is logly

```
