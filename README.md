## Getting Started

## Installation

To install the stable version of `logly`, use:
```bash
pip install logly
```

If you want to install the latest development version directly from GitHub, you can run:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly.git
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can use `logly` in your Python project for logging. Here is a basic example of how to set it up and use it:
```python
# Import Logly
from logly import Logly

# Create a Logly instance
logly = Logly()

# Start logging to store the logs in a text file
logly.start_logging()  # Make sure to include this or else the logs will only display without being saved to a file

logly.info("Application started successfully.")
logly.info("User logged in", color=logly.COLOR.GREEN)  # with custom color

# Log messages with different levels and colors
logly.info("Database connection established", "Connection details: host=db.local, port=5432", color=logly.COLOR.CYAN)
logly.warn("API rate limit exceeded", "API request count exceeded 1000", color=logly.COLOR.YELLOW)
logly.error("Database connection failed", "Unable to reach database at db.local", color=logly.COLOR.RED)
logly.debug("User request details", "User requested resource /api/data", color=logly.COLOR.BLUE)
logly.critical("Critical system failure", "Disk space usage exceeded 95%", color=logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.fatal("Application crashed", "Unhandled exception in user module", color=logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.trace("Debug trace", "Trace info: function call stack", color=logly.COLOR.BLUE)
logly.log("System status", "All systems operational", color=logly.COLOR.WHITE)

# Stop logging (messages will be displayed but not logged to file after this point)
logly.stop_logging()

# Log more messages after stopping logging (messages will be displayed but not logged in file)
logly.info("User session ended", "User logged out", color=logly.COLOR.CYAN)
logly.warn("Low disk space", "Disk space is below 10%", color=logly.COLOR.YELLOW)
logly.error("File not found", "Unable to find /config/settings.json", color=logly.COLOR.RED)

# Example of retrieving and printing a logged message
get_message = logly.info("New feature deployed", "Version 2.0 live now", color=logly.COLOR.RED)
print(get_message)  # You can use the returned message in your application (optional)

# Log message with custom color and no timestamp
logly.info("Custom log without time", "This log message does not include a timestamp", color=logly.COLOR.RED, show_time=False)

# Start logging again
logly.start_logging()

# Set the default file path and max file size
logly.set_default_file_path("application_logs.txt")  # Set the default file path
logly.set_default_max_file_size(50)  # Set default max file size to 50 MB

# Log messages with default settings (using default file path and max file size)
logly.info("Default logging example", "Logging to default file path and size")
logly.warn("File logging size test", "Max file size set to 50 MB", log_to_file=False)

# Log messages with custom file path and max file size (optional)
logly.info("Logging with custom file path", "This will create a new log file", file_path="logs/custom_log.txt", max_file_size=25)
logly.warn("Auto file size management", "Log file will be auto-deleted when size exceeds limit", file_path="logs/auto_delete_log.txt", max_file_size=25, auto=True)

# Access color constants directly for logging
logly.info("Using color constants directly", "This message is in red", color=logly.COLOR.RED)

# Disable color for logging
logly.color_enabled = False
logly.info("Logging without color", "This log message is displayed without color", color=logly.COLOR.RED)

# Enable color for specific log message
logly.info("Enable color for this message", "This message will have color", color=logly.COLOR.RED, color_enabled=True)

# Disable color for specific log message
logly.info("Disable color for this message", "This message will be displayed without color", color=logly.COLOR.RED, color_enabled=False)

# Display logged messages (this will display all the messages logged so far)
print("Logged Messages:")
for message in logly.logged_messages:
    print(message)

```

## Set the Default Path

If you encounter an error related to the default file path, you can use the following code snippet to set the default path:

```python3
import os
from logly import Logly

logly = Logly()
logly.start_logging()

# Set the default file path and maximum file size
logly.set_default_max_file_size(50)
logger = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "log.txt")
logly.set_default_file_path(logger)
```
This will set the default file path, and you can customize it according to your requirements.

if you want to set the default path for the log file, you can use the following code snippet

```python3
from logly import Logly
logly = Logly()
logly.set_default_file_path("log.txt")
```

if you faced an error like [`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'log.txt'`](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly/issues/4) you can use the following code snippet to set the default path

```python3
import os
from logly import Logly

logly = Logly() # initialize the logly
logly.start_logging() # make sure to include this or else the log will only display without storing it

logly.set_default_max_file_size(50) # optional
logger = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "log.txt") # This will ensure the path location to create the log.txt on current directory
logly.set_default_file_path(logger)
```
for more information, check the [repository](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly).

## Color Options:

### Default Color Options:

| Level    | Color Code      |
| -------- | --------------- |
| INFO     | CYAN            |
| WARNING  | YELLOW          |
| ERROR    | RED             |
| DEBUG    | BLUE            |
| CRITICAL | BRIGHT RED      |
| TRACE    | BLUE            |
| DEFAULT  | WHITE           |

### Custom Color Options:

You can use any of the following color codes for custom coloring:

| NAME     | Color Code      |
|----------| --------------- |
| CYAN      | CYAN            |
| YELLOW   | YELLOW          |
|  RED       | RED             |
|  BLUE      | BLUE            |
| BRIGHT RED | CRITICAL     |
|WHITE   | WHITE           |

For example, you can use `color=logly.COLOR.RED` for the red color.

## Tips & Tricks
If you want to use logly in your project files without creating a new object in each Python file or class, you can create a file named logly.py. In this file, initialize logly and configure the defaults. Now, you can easily import and use it throughout your project:

`logly.py`
```python3
# logly.py in your root or custom path
# Import Logly

from logly import Logly
import os
logly = Logly()
logly.start_logging()

# Set the default file path and maximum file size
logly.set_default_max_file_size(50)
logger = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "log.txt") # This will ensure the path location to create the log.txt 
logly.set_default_file_path(logger)

# Start logging again
logly.start_logging()
```
you can now use the logly by


`main.py`
```python3
from logly import logly # make sure to import it some IDE may automatically import it on top

logly.info("msg","hello this is logly", color=logly.COLOR.RED) # with custom color of red

```
### output 
```
[XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX: XX] INFO: msg: hello this is logly

```
