    # Install logly
    pip install logly
    ```

=== "conda"

    ```bash
    # Create conda environment
    conda create -n myproject python=3.12

    # Activate environment
    conda activate myproject

    # Install logly
    pip install logly
    ```

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    # Create project with uv
    uv init myproject
    cd myproject

    # Add logly

## Troubleshooting

### Import Error

If you encounter import errors:

```python
ImportError: cannot import name 'logger' from 'logly'
```

**Output:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: cannot import name 'logger' from 'logly'
```

**Solution**: Ensure you're using Python 3.9+:

```bash
python --version  # Should be >= 3.9
pip install --upgrade logly
```

**Output:**
```
Python 3.12.0
Collecting logly
  Downloading logly-0.1.2.tar.gz (15 kB)
Successfully installed logly-0.1.2
```

### Build Errors (Source Installation)

If building from source fails:

1. **Install Rust toolchain**:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Update maturin**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade maturin
   ```

3. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   cargo clean
   maturin develop --release
   ```

### Permission Errors

On Unix systems, if you get permission errors:

```bash
# Use --user flag
pip install --user logly

# Or use sudo (not recommended)
sudo pip install logly
```
