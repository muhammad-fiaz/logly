## Migration Guides

### From Python `logging`

Logly is largely compatible with Python's standard `logging`, but with performance benefits:

```python
# Before (logging)
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.info("Hello")

# After (logly)
from logly import logger
logger.configure(level="INFO")
logger.add("console")
logger.info("Hello")
```

**Key Differences:**
- ‚úÖ **Explicit sinks**: Must call `logger.add()` to add output targets
- ‚úÖ **Template strings**: Use `{variable}` syntax instead of `%s`
- ‚úÖ **Structured logging**: Use kwargs for structured fields
- ‚úÖ **Cleanup required**: Call `logger.complete()` at exit

### From Loguru

Logly API is inspired by Loguru but built for performance:

```python
# Before (loguru)
from loguru import logger
logger.add("file.log", rotation="500 MB")
logger.info("Hello {name}", name="World")

# After (logly)
from logly import logger
logger.add("file.log", rotation="500 MB")
logger.info("Hello {name}", name="World")
```

**Key Differences:**
- ‚úÖ **Must configure**: Call `logger.configure()` before adding sinks
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: 10-100x faster for high-throughput scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Type safety**: Full type hints for IDE support
- ‚úÖ **Rust backend**: Native performance
